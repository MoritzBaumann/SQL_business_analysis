# SQL_business_analysis
In this project, I use SQL queries to explore the relational database of a fictive Brazilian e-commerce company, __Magist__.
In particular, I'm interested in its technology products and sellers and answer related business questions.

It is a learning project, in which I familiarized myself with the SQL language.

### Content
- two sql-scripts
  - one explores the database
  - the other seeks to answer specific business quetsions
- a pdf showing the relations in the database
- the data as csv files in the 'data' folder
